### How to Install

Loaf is a python script, so just putting the script somewhere on your `$PATH` is sufficient.

We've created an installation script that will clone the git repository into a directory located at `$HOME/.loaf/`, then offer instructions on how to add the directory to your `$PATH`.

To perform the installation, run the following script:

    bash -c "$(curl https://raw.github.com/gist/1958120/7ea89a27f0b3eba463970217b7acc7b44792057b/install_loaf 2>/dev/null)"

You can read the contents of the script here: https://raw.github.com/gist/1958120/7ea89a27f0b3eba463970217b7acc7b44792057b/install_loaf
